smash the patriarchy and the matriarchy

Cowering like cowards cowering in
Concrete showers in Rikers Island
Victims, we the wolves that's wilding
We often smilin' at sights of violence
Acting brave and courageous
Ain't advantageous for health and safety
So when we say, "Run the jewels"
Just run 'em, baby, please don't delay me
And that goes for a guy or lady
The fam, goddamn, we fuckin' crazy
I'll pull this pistol
Put it on your poodle or your fuckin' baby
She clutched the pearls, said, "What in the world?"
And, "I won't give up shit!"
I put the pistol on that poodle
And I shot that bitch
